      <p class="introduction">Cat is a very loving animal. Cat says meow.
        Cats are fascinating creatures with a long history of
        companionship with humans. Here are some interesting 
        facts about them:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b> Domestication:</b> Cats were domesticated around 
            9,000 years ago, primarily for their ability 
            to control pests like rodents.</li>
          <li> <b>Ancestry:</b>  Domestic cats (Felis catus) are
               descendants of wild cats, particularly the
                African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica).
                 They share about 95% of their DNA with 
                 their wild ancestors.</li>
        <li><b>Variety:</b> There are over 70 recognized cat breeds 
          worldwide, each with its own unique physical 
          characteristics and personality traits.</li>
        <li><b>Communication:</b> Cats communicate through 
          a variety of vocalizations, body language,
           and scent marking. Meowing is a behavior 
           they primarily use to communicate with
            humans, rather than other cats.</li>
        <li><b>Agility:</b> Cats are known for their 
          incredible agility and athleticism. 
          They are capable of jumping up to six 
          times their body length in a single bound.</li>
        <li><b>Grooming:</b> Cats are meticulous groomers and 
          spend a significant portion of their waking 
          hours cleaning themselves. This behavior helps 
          them regulate body temperature, remove loose 
          fur, and maintain hygiene</li>
          <li><b>Nocturnal Hunters:</b> Cats are crepuscular animals,
             meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk.
              This behavior is believed to be inherited from
               their wild ancestors, who were nocturnal hunters.</li>
          <li><b>Whiskers:</b> A cat's whiskers are highly sensitivile 
            tacthairs that help them navigate their environment,
             detect changes in air currents, and determine the
              width of openings they can fit through.</li>
              <li><b>Independence:</b> Cats are often seen as 
                independent animals compared to dogs, but 
                they still form strong bonds with their 
                human companions. They can be affectionate 
                and enjoy social interaction on their own terms.</li>
              <li><b>Health Benefits:</b> Studies have shown that owning a
                 cat can have positive effects on human health, including
                  reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. The act of 
                  petting a cat can release calming hormones in humans.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="conclusion">Overall, cats are complex and intriguing animals that have 
                captivated humans for thousands of years with their beauty,
                 grace, and unique behaviors.
